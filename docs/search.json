    "section": "",
    "text": "Quarto is an “open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc”. What does that mean?\nIt means that you can use a simple text file to create documents like blogs, papers, books etc. This blog will be generated using Quarto. Quarto takes simple text files written in markdown and converts those documents into a number of different formats.\nQuarto allows you to embed code written in R, python, julia and Observable JS into your documents and that code will be executable. This makes it easy to share code for analysis or teaching or reminding yourself how things work!.\nBelow I’ll document how I set up this blog on Github pages using Quarto.\n\n\nFirst you’ll need to have the version control sofware git installed on your system. If you’re not familiar with git then there’s some good teaching here. Once you have git installed you have to set your identity.\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"YourEmail@XYZ.com\"\nThe email you use should be the same one you’ll use when you sign up for Github.\nYou can also set a default branch for your code. I use main for this. This is where the final code for the blog will live.\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\nYou’ll also need an account on Github. Github provides a free service called Github pages that allows you to host a free website.\nYou’ll also need to install Quarto.\nOnce we have git & Quarto installed and a Github account ready the workflow we’ll follow here is:\n\nCreate a blog repository on Github\nCopy (clone) that repository to our local computer\nSetup the blog structure in the local repository using Quarto\nCreate content for the blog using Quarto\nPush the content to the online repository\n\nOnce we’ve done the first three steps the last two steps can be repeated as we add new blog posts.\nI’ll be using a Unix based operating system either Mac OSX or linux & we’ll be using the command line. If you want to follow the process on Windows you’ll probably need to change a few commands used to create files or change directories from Unix commands to Windows commands. The git and quarto commands will all remain the same.\nOnce you have installed git and set up your git identity go to Github, create a free account and set up the various security options. Install Quarto on your computer.\n\n\n\nOn Github create a new repo named your_github_username.github.io replacing your_github_username with your actual Github username. Do not add a README or license file just now.\nOn your local computer change to the directory you want to use for your blog and clone the Github repo into that directory.\ncd ~/blog_directory\ngit clone git@github.com:THE_REPO_ADDRESS\nif you’re using ssh.\ncd ~/blog_directory\ngit clone https://github.com/THE_REPO_ADDRESS\nif you’re using https.\nThis will download the files on Github into the local directory. You’ll probably get a warning like:\nwarning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.\nThat’s ok… you have cloned an empty repository!\n\n\n\nThere are full instructions here.\nChange into the local repo you just cloned.\ncd ~/blog_directory/your_github_username.github.io\nCreate a local copy of your blog by typing:\nquarto create-project --type website:blog\nQuarto will create several files and directories required to create the blog:\n\n_quarto.yml\nindex.qmd\nabout.qmd\nposts/\nposts/_metadata.yml\nstyles.css\n\nAdd an empty file named .nojekyll at the top level:\n# change directory\ncd your_github_username.github.io\n# add a file\ntouch .nojekyll\nThis is required so that Github pages will serve our blog properly later. See the Github pages section here.\nWe also need to set the output directory in the _quarto.yml file so the top of the file reads:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nIf you want to add social media details you can make edits to the about.qmd file (see the webpage above).\n\n\n\nMove into the new directory created by Quarto:\ncd your_github_username.github.io\nType git init. This will tell git to start tracking the files in the blog directory. You can make sure this is working by typing git status & git should list all the directories and files in the your_github_username.github.io directory. You should also see that you are on the main branch.\n\n\n\nGit allows us to create different branches for projects we are working on. At the moment we only have one branch in our blog project - the main branch. For adding content etc we do not want to work on the main branch; we want the main branch to be the destination for code/posts we know we want to publish.\nOn your local machine create a new branch in the repo called e.g. adding-content.\ngit checkout -b adding-content\nYou should see a message Switched to a new branch 'adding-content'.\nAs you create content you will create that content on the adding-content branch. Once you’re happy with that content you can merge the adding-content and main branches. That way you’re never going to ‘break’ the main branch (the stuff you will actually blog) with code/content that doesn’t work.\nBefore we go any further we’ll push everything we have done to the adding-content branch on our local machine.\n# make sure we're on the adding-content branch\ngit status\n# add all the files & changes; . means add everything\ngit add .\n# commit the changes to the git repo\ngit commit -m \"started adding-content branch\"\n# check\ngit status\nYou should see a message:\nOn branch adding-content\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n\n\nThe workflow to create content is to write in markdown and then use the tools in Quarto to render the markdown to html. If you made your blog repo as above with Quarto then Quarto will take care of adding blog posts to the index page of your blog.\nCreate a new Quarto file written in markdown. As you’re doing so you can check what the page will look like using the Render button in RStudio orVS Code if you’re using either of these for your writing.\nOnce you’re satisfied with the markdown file create a new folder in the /posts directory of your blog repo. Give the folder an informative name.\n# change to posts dir\ncd your_github.username.github.io/posts\n# create new dir to hold current content\nmkdir quarto_github_pages\n# move .qmd file to posts/new_dir\ncp path/to/content.qmd posts/quarto_github_pages\nNow we can add this file to git.\n# check your on adding content\ngit status\n# add the file\ngit add posts/quarto_github_pages/content.qmd\n# commit the file & add a message\ngit commit -m \"added first post to blog\"\n# check all is well\ngit status\n\n\n\nNow we have some content we can use quarto to render the actual site. Make sure you are in the top level directory of your blog (e.g. your_github_username.github.io) and type quarto preview to preview the site.\nIf it all looks good press ctrl+c to stop the site being served.\nYou can now render the site with quarto render. This will add several new files & directories.\nAdd these to the adding-content branch following the git workflow.\ngit status # make sure you are on adding-content branch\ngit add .\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"some useful commit message\"\ngit status\nNow we’re ready to send the site to Github.\n\n\n\nWe want to push the files we have created to the adding-content branch online.\ngit push origin adding-content\nGo to Github and log in if you have to. You should see a message that the adding-content branch has had content pushed to it.\n\n\n\nPull request\n\n\nPress the green button and follow the prompts to merge your changes to the main branch on Github.\nOn the GitHub page for your repo go to Settings (top right of the page) & scroll down until you see the section for GitHub pages. Click on the Source (it probably says Deploy from a branch) & select /docs.\n\n\n\nSet serve directory\n\n\nPress save. This tells GitHub Pages to look in themain branch of the project and in the docs directory for files to serve.\n\n\n\nSo far we have made all our changes to the local adding-content branch, sent these changes to the adding-content branch online and merged those changes with the main branch online. Our local main branch needs to be synchronised to the online main branch.\nIn your local blog directory checkout your main branch.\ngit checkout main\nNow pull the content from the online main branch down to your local machine.\ngit pull origin main\nYour local main branch and your online main branch will now be the same.\n\n\n\nA lot of what we did above was once off. For subsequent posts we will:\n\nDraft content in markdown\nTrack that content on the local adding-content branch\n\ngit checkout adding-content\ngit status # make sure you're on adding-content\ngit add XYZ\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"some commit message\"\ngit status\n\nPush the adding-content branch to Github when we’re ready to publish the page\n\ngit push origin adding-content\n\nMerge the changes to the main branch online using a Github pull request\n\nGithub should automatically serve the page we created.\n\nPull the finalised main branch from Github back to the local machine\n\ngit checkout main   \ngit pull origin main"

    "section": "Preliminaries",
    "text": "Preliminaries\nR has a lot of base functionality for data handling, exploration & statistical analysis; it’s what R was designed for. However we are going to make use of the ‘tidyverse’ (Wickham et al. 2019) because it has become a very popular approach to data handling & analysis in R.\n\nThe tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming.\n\nAs well as data handling & visualisation we will also be carrying out some statistical testing. R is well served for basic frequentist statistics and there’s nothing extra we need. For Bayesian analysis we will use the Stan probabilistic programming language (Carpenter et al. 2017). We will code a model by hand and use the cmdstanr package to pass that model to Stan. We will also use the brms package (Bürkner 2017) which makes writing Stan models easier.

This also makes it easier to carry out later data wrangling, plotting and testing.\n\n# wide to long data\ndata_inL &lt;- pivot_longer(data_in, cols = `girths`:`Waist`, names_to = 'measure', values_to = 'value')\nhead(data_inL)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  sex   measure   value\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 M     girths    10.8 \n2 M     bia        5.7 \n3 M     DW         9.22\n4 M     jackson    4.75\n5 M     HW        17   \n6 M     skinfolds 50.8 \n\n\nNow the values for each individual and each measurement technique are identified by rows rather than spread across row & column combinations. Exploration with plots is an essential step for checking values and the distribution of data. The tidyverse provides the ggplot2 package for this.\n\n# custom colors for male & female\nplot_cols &lt;- c('firebrick', 'cornflowerblue')\n# make the plot\nggplot(data_inL, aes(sex, value, colour = sex)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = plot_cols) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(~measure, scales = \"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of mad values in the BMI and girths variables. For the rest of the analysis we’ll concentrate on the BMI variable. Removing outliers is a contentious subject but here a BMI of 2 is incompatible with life! So we’ll remove this unreasonably low value.\n\n# get just bmi data\nbmi_data &lt;- data_inL %&gt;% filter(measure == \"BMI\")\n# remove low value\nbmi_data &lt;- bmi_data %&gt;% filter(value &gt; 15)\n# check with a new plot\nbmi_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(sex, value, colour = sex)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 3) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = plot_cols) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") \n\n\n\n\nMuch better!\n\n\nFrequentist testing\nNow let’s use a t-test to examine whether male and female BMI is different. In R basic statistical tests are easy; there are no extraneous packages to load and there’s a pretty simple ‘formula’ interface using the tilde (~). Note that by default R uses Welch’s t-test which does not assume equal variances in each group (see ?t.test).\n\n# t-test\nt.test(value ~ sex, data = bmi_data)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  value by sex\nt = -2.1134, df = 192.05, p-value = 0.03586\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group F and group M is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -1.59338708 -0.05499779\nsample estimates:\nmean in group F mean in group M \n       22.83834        23.66253 \n\n\nThe difference between male & female BMI is significant. This means that in a hypothetical long series of repeats of this study with different samples from the same population we would expect to see a difference as big or bigger between the sexes in more than 95% of those study repeats.\n\n\nBayesian testing\nThere are several packages for Bayesian statistics in R. We’ll use the cmdstanr package to write a Bayesian model in the Stan probabilistic programming language for assessing the difference between male and female BMI. Stan will do the heavy lifting for us (Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC sampling)) and return a data object we can use in R.\n\n# create data list\nsex &lt;- bmi_data %&gt;% select(sex) %&gt;% pull() # labels for participant sex\n# convert to dummy coding; females are coded as 0\nsex_dummy &lt;- ifelse(sex == 'F', 0, 1)\n# bmi values\nbmi &lt;- bmi_data %&gt;% select(value) %&gt;% pull() \n# get num subjects\nN &lt;- nrow(bmi_data) # length of dataset\n# make a list of data to pass to Stan\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = N, sex = sex_dummy, bmi = bmi)\n\n# define the model in Stan as a text string; can also pass in a separate .stan file\n# stan code is written in blocks (data, parameters, model etc) defined by {}\nmodel_string &lt;- \"\n\n// data we want to model\ndata{\n  int&lt;lower=1&gt; N; // length of the data\n  vector[N] bmi; // bmi data of length N\n  vector[N] sex; // sex data of length N\n}\n\n// parameters we want to estimate\nparameters{\n  real beta0; // intercept\n  real beta1; // slope\n  real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; // residual sd, must be positive\n}\n\n// priors for model\nmodel{\n  // priors\n  beta0 ~ normal(25, 10); // intercept\n  beta1 ~ normal(0, 5); // slope\n  sigma ~ normal(0,100); // defined as positive only in parameters block\n  \n  //likelihood\n  bmi ~ normal(beta0 + beta1*sex, sigma);\n}\"\n\n# write file to temp dir\nstan_mod_temp &lt;- write_stan_file(model_string, dir = tempdir())\n# create Stan model\nstan_mod &lt;- cmdstan_model(stan_mod_temp)\n# fit the model using Stan\nfit &lt;- stan_mod$sample(data = data_list, seed = 123, chains = 4, parallel_chains = 2, refresh = 500 )\n\nRunning MCMC with 4 chains, at most 2 in parallel...\n\nChain 1 Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup) \nChain 1 Iteration:  500 / 2000 [ 25%]  (Warmup) \nChain 1 Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup) \nChain 1 Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling) \nChain 1 Iteration: 1500 / 2000 [ 75%]  (Sampling) \nChain 1 Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling) \nChain 2 Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup) \nChain 2 Iteration:  500 / 2000 [ 25%]  (Warmup) \nChain 2 Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup) \nChain 2 Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling) \nChain 2 Iteration: 1500 / 2000 [ 75%]  (Sampling) \nChain 2 Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling) \nChain 1 finished in 0.0 seconds.\nChain 2 finished in 0.0 seconds.\nChain 3 Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup) \nChain 3 Iteration:  500 / 2000 [ 25%]  (Warmup) \nChain 3 Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup) \nChain 3 Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling) \nChain 3 Iteration: 1500 / 2000 [ 75%]  (Sampling) \nChain 3 Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling) \nChain 4 Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup) \nChain 4 Iteration:  500 / 2000 [ 25%]  (Warmup) \nChain 4 Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup) \nChain 4 Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling) \nChain 4 Iteration: 1500 / 2000 [ 75%]  (Sampling) \nChain 4 Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling) \nChain 3 finished in 0.0 seconds.\nChain 4 finished in 0.0 seconds.\n\nAll 4 chains finished successfully.\nMean chain execution time: 0.0 seconds.\nTotal execution time: 0.3 seconds.\n\n# summary plus diagnostics\nfit$summary()\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 10\n  variable     mean   median    sd   mad       q5     q95  rhat ess_bulk\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 lp__     -306.    -306.    1.19  0.980 -308.    -305.    1.00    1899.\n2 beta0      22.8     22.8   0.313 0.322   22.3     23.4   1.00    2021.\n3 beta1       0.813    0.812 0.406 0.405    0.136    1.47  1.00    1965.\n4 sigma       2.82     2.82  0.140 0.140    2.60     3.07  1.00    2856.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: ess_tail &lt;num&gt;\n\n# just the params\n# fit$summary(c(\"beta0\", \"beta1\", \"sigma\"), \"mean\", \"sd\")\n\nThe output tells us that the estimated means for female BMI is 22.8 (females were dummy coded as 0). Given the priors we used we can say that there is a 90% probability that the value for female BMI lies between 22.3 and 23.4. The estimated male BMI is 0.81 (with 90% probability of being between 0.13 & 1.48) units greater than female BMI i.e. ~23.6. The mean values are the same as estimated by the frequentist \\(t\\)-test procedure.\nTo plot the posterior distributions we can extract the posterior draws and use the bayesplot package.\n\n# get the draws; uses posterior package\ndraws &lt;- fit$draws(variables = c('beta0', 'beta1', 'sigma'))\n# plot the draws; bayesplot package\nmcmc_dens(draws)\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the posterior distribution for the male BMI is as simple as adding together the draws for beta0 and beta1.\n\n# draws to dataframe\ndraws_df &lt;- as_draws_df(draws)\n# posterior for male bmi included\nbmi_posteriors &lt;- draws_df %&gt;% mutate(male_bmi_post = beta0 + beta1)\nmcmc_dens(bmi_posteriors, pars = c('beta0', 'male_bmi_post', 'sigma'))\n\n\n\n\nThere are easier ways to create basic (and more complex) Bayesian models than writing out the Stan code by hand. The brms package allows us to write Bayesian models using R modeling syntax. The model is translated to Stan and then compiled & run.\n\n# brms bayesian modelling; same priors as above\nbrms_mod &lt;- brm(value ~ sex, data = bmi_data,\n                prior =
